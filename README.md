# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Analysis Overview

The purpose of this analysis was twofold:
* The first purpose was to determine the number of employees retiring, broken out by Title to help the manager prepare for a wave of retirement known as the "silver tsunami."
* The second purpose was to identify a list of employees who are eligible to participate in a Mentorship Program. We achieved this through a query that pulled current employees born in 1965.

## Results

* Employees with the title "Senior Engineeer" were the largest set of employees retiring when grouped by title.
* The majority (over 50%) of employees retiring had the word "Senior" in their title.
* Only 2 employees with the title "Manager" were set to retire.
* There were a total of 1,549 employees who are eligible for the Mentorship Program, based on the criteria of being born in 1965.

## Summary

As the "silver tsunami" makes an impact 90,398 total roles will need to be filled if all retiring employees are to be replaced.

There are 1,549 employees who qualify to be mentors. This is a substantial number.
